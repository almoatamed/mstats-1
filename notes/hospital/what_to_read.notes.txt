only study the topics that may you dont understand

- read the express server documentation in order to understand how it handles requests ( no need for indepth study, only basic understanding will do for the current time)
  - https://github.com/bradtraversy/express_crash_course ( sample code )
  - https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html ( official guide "hello world!")
- read, w3 mysql guide ( insert and select for now will do ) 
  - https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/mysql_like.asp

in writing, follow the code pattern in similar that provided on the source code 
   ( perhaps you may would like to wait untill i write the first 
     api ( user registration ) and then try to write your own ) 
 
good luck !!!!!
